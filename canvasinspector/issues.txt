ISSUES

1. If the canvas is shown by hovering over a node in the HTML panel it is necessary to click twice to select the node, once to hide the canvas and once to select the node.

2. If the canvas is shown by hovering over a node in the HTML panel and the user moves the cursor into the content area (over the canvas) then inspection begins in the content area.

3. Highlighter is offset on the Mac

4. Canvas covers scrollbar for framesets

5. Selection of nodes on large pages appears is a lot slower than in previous versions but maybe this is an HTML Panel issue.

TODO

1. Remove second body tag ... the canvas can be injected directly into the document until a suitable XUL widget comes along.

2. Look at computed style for canvas tag and be sure to account for any offsets that could be inherited from the document.
