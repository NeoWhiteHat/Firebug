The following are items that need further work:
- Integration with the Firebug Activation model

    combinations into distinct changes within the data rather than 2 events.
- Filter all background changes made by Firebug (i.e. insertion of highlight element styles)
- Diff Monitor
 - Search
 - CSS Links

 - UI cleanup
- Unified Diff Panel
- Examine Undo/Redo functionality
- Testing
 - Automated Tests
 - Firebug Editors
 - Automated UI testing
 - CSS Tests
 - Firebug DOM Change Tests
