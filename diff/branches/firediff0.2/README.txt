Firediff:
Firediff is a Firebug extension that tracks changes to a pages DOM and CSS. This
allows developers to examine the changes made in their debugging as well as those
made by the page itself.

Dependencies:
Firediff has been tested under Firebug 1.4, but may support prior versions.
It works best with customizations to Firebug that allow for improved tracking
of changes made by firebug as well as CSS tracking. These changes are included
in the 1.4 branch of firebug as of revision 2378.

Method of operation:
To track changes to the DOM, Firediff uses the DOM MutationEvents
(http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html#Events-eventgroupings-mutationevents)
to record all changes made to the page by both Firebug edits and application edits.

In order to track CSS changes, Firediff relies on the Firebug.CSSModule to record
changes made to the page's CSS. As a consequence of this, Firediff can only track
changes made within Firebug. Any CSS modifications performed by the application
will not be recorded by Firediff.

Panels:
The following panels have been proposed for implementation within Firediff. Except
where noted these have not yet been implemented and may be prohibitively difficult
to implement.

  Diff Monitor:
  Displays a log of all the changes made to the page. This can be filtered by 
  Firebug and Application created changes.
  
  This panel has been partially implemented.
  
  Diff Snapshot:
  Displays a snapshot of the page's markup or CSS as a result of a given change.
  
  Initial implementation of this feature has been implemented in the form of the
  "All Modules" panel. The intent is to extend this implementation to support the
  snapshot in time functionality.
  
  Unified Diff:
  Generates a unified diff for the changes made within the page. As much of a files
  formatting data is lost in rendering process, the file base content for this view
  will be generated using a plugable formatter. Most files generated by this will
  not be usable by automated diff tools such as patch, but can be used by the
  developer to make manual changes to the files in question.

Data Model:
Firediff maintains an internal model of the changes that have occurred within the
page. This model is able to combine related changes into single change as
appropriate. Each event implemented in the model supports apply and revert
functionality on arbitrary trees.
