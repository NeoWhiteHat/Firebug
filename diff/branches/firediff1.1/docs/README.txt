Firediff:
Firediff is a Firebug extension that tracks changes to a pages DOM and CSS. This
allows developers to examine the changes made in their debugging as well as those
made by the page itself.

Features:
- Monitor:
  Displays a log of all the changes made to the page. This can be filtered by 
  Firebug and Application created changes.

- Show Snapshot
  Displays a snapshot of the page's markup or CSS as a result of a given change.

- Save Snapshot
  Saves a snapshot fo the page's markup or CSS at a given point in time.

- Unified Diff
  Generates a Unified Diff of the changes made to the page. The files generated by
  this represent the best guess match for the original source file and may require
  manual application.

Dependencies:
Firediff 1.0 requires Firebug 1.5.

Method of operation:
To track changes to the DOM, Firediff uses the DOM MutationEvents
(http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html#Events-eventgroupings-mutationevents)
to record all changes made to the page by both Firebug edits and application edits.

In order to track CSS changes, Firediff relies on the Firebug.CSSModule to record
changes made to the page's CSS. As a consequence of this, Firediff can only track
changes made within Firebug. Any CSS modifications performed by the application
will not be recorded by Firediff.

Data Model:
Firediff maintains an internal model of the changes that have occurred within the
page. This model is able to combine related changes into single change as
appropriate. Each event implemented in the model supports apply and revert
functionality on arbitrary trees.

Building From Source:
Firediff source is available at http://fbug.googlecode.com/svn/diff/

From source Firediff can be run with or without Fireformat integrated.
Without:
* Checkout Firediff source
* Register the project source directory path in the Firefox profile

When working in this mode no build scripts are necessary, but object to string formatting
will not work unless Fireformat is installed as a separate extension.

With:
* Checkout Firediff source
* Checkout Fireformat source from http://fbug.googlecode.com/svn/extensions/fireformat/
* In the Firediff directory create local.properties with an entry named fireformat_dir whose
  value points to the Fireformat directory
* Run ant merge
* Register the build/merged directory path in the Firefox profile

When working in this mode all functionality will be available but `ant merge` must be run after
any changes are made to the source of either Firediff or Fireformat. This is the mode that Firediff
currently ships.
