firediff prototype for diff support in Firebug

install as extension to Firebug 1.4+

0.1 issues:
 * The editors are absolute so resize/wrap stuff cause them to be misaligned. Needs CSS expertise
 * Need "all/one" toggle
 * Need to merge changes from same element.
 * watch panel shows up but only in the update not prev windows
